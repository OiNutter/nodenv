# Groom your app’s Node environment with nodenv.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OiNutter/nodenv.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OiNutter/nodenv)

Use nodenv to pick a Node version for your application and guarantee
that your development environment matches production. Put nodenv to work
with [NPM](http://npmjs.org/) for painless Node upgrades and
bulletproof deployments.

**Powerful in development.** Specify your app's Node version once,
  in a single file. Keep all your teammates on the same page. No
  headaches running apps on different versions of Node. Just Works™
  from the command line. Override the Node version anytime: just set 
  an environment variable.

**Rock-solid in production.** Your application's executables are its
  interface with ops. With nodenv you'll never again need to `cd` in 
  a cron job or Chef recipe to ensure you've selected the right runtime. 
  The Node version dependency lives in one place—your app—so upgrades 
  and rollbacks are atomic, even when you switch versions.

**One thing well.** nodenv is concerned solely with switching Node
  versions. It's simple and predictable. A rich plugin ecosystem lets
  you tailor it to suit your needs. Compile your own Node versions, or
  use the [node-build](https://github.com/OiNutter/node-build)
  plugin to automate the process. See more [plugins on the
  wiki](https://github.com/OiNutter/nodenv/wiki/Plugins).

## How It Works

At a high level, nodenv intercepts Node commands using shim
executables injected into your `PATH`, determines which Node version
has been specified by your application, and passes your commands along
to the correct Node installation.

### Understanding PATH

When you run a command like `node`, your operating system
searches through a list of directories to find an executable file with
that name. This list of directories lives in an environment variable
called `PATH`, with each directory in the list separated by a colon:

    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

Directories in `PATH` are searched from left to right, so a matching
executable in a directory at the beginning of the list takes
precedence over another one at the end. In this example, the
`/usr/local/bin` directory will be searched first, then `/usr/bin`,
then `/bin`.

### Understanding Shims

nodenv works by inserting a directory of _shims_ at the front of your
`PATH`:

    ~/.nodenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

Through a process called _rehashing_, nodenv maintains shims in that
directory to match every Node command across every installed version
of Node—`node`, `npm`, and so on.

Shims are lightweight executables that simply pass your command along
to nodenv. So with nodenv installed, when you run, say, `npm`, your
operating system will do the following:

* Search your `PATH` for an executable file named `npm`
* Find the nodenv shim named `npm` at the beginning of your `PATH`
* Run the shim named `npm`, which in turn passes the command along to
  nodenv

### Choosing the Node Version

When you execute a shim, nodenv determines which Node version to use by
reading it from the following sources, in this order:

1. The `NODENV_VERSION` environment variable, if specified. You can use
   the [`nodenv shell`](#nodenv-shell) command to set this environment
   variable in your current shell session.

2. The application-specific `.node-version` file in the current
   directory, if present. You can modify the current directory's
   `.node-version` file with the [`nodenv local`](#nodenv-local)
   command.

3. The first `.node-version` file found by searching each parent
   directory until reaching the root of your filesystem, if any.

4. The global `~/.nodenv/version` file. You can modify this file using
   the [`nodenv global`](#nodenv-global) command. If the global version
   file is not present, nodenv assumes you want to use the "system"
   Node—i.e. whatever version would be run if nodenv weren't in your
   path.

### Locating the Node Installation

Once nodenv has determined which version of Node your application has
specified, it passes the command along to the corresponding Node
installation.

Each Node version is installed into its own directory under
`~/.nodenv/versions`. For example, you might have these versions
installed:

* `~/.nodenv/versions/0.8.22/`
* `~/.nodenv/versions/0.10.0/`

Version names to nodenv are simply the names of the directories in
`~/.nodenv/versions`.

## Installation

**Compatibility note**: nodenv is _incompatible_ with NVM. Please make
  sure to fully uninstall NVM and remove any references to it from
  your shell initialization files before installing nodenv.

If you're on Mac OS X, consider
[installing with Homebrew](#homebrew-on-mac-os-x). (Coming Soon)

### Basic GitHub Checkout

This will get you going with the latest version of nodenv and make it
easy to fork and contribute any changes back upstream.

1. Check out nodenv into `~/.nodenv`.

    ~~~ sh
    $ git clone git://github.com/OiNutter/nodenv.git ~/.nodenv
    ~~~

2. Add `~/.nodenv/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the `nodenv`
   command-line utility.

    ~~~ sh
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.nodenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ~~~

    **Ubuntu note**: Modify your `~/.profile` instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

3. Add `nodenv init` to your shell to enable shims and autocompletion.

    ~~~ sh
    $ echo 'eval "$(nodenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ~~~

    _Same as in previous step, use `~/.profile` on Ubuntu, `~/.zshrc` for Zsh._

4. Restart your shell as a login shell so the path changes take effect.
    You can now begin using nodenv.

    ~~~ sh
    $ exec $SHELL -l
    ~~~

5. Install [node-build](https://github.com/OiNutter/node-build),
   which provides an `nodenv install` command that simplifies the
   process of installing new Node versions.

    ~~~
    $ nodenv install 0.10.0
    ~~~

   As an alternative, you can download and compile Node yourself into
   `~/.nodenv/versions/`.

6. Rebuild the shim executables. You should do this any time you
   install a new Node executable (for example, when installing a new
   Node version, or when installing a gem that provides a command).

    ~~~
    $ nodenv rehash
    ~~~

#### Upgrading

If you've installed nodenv manually using git, you can upgrade your
installation to the cutting-edge version at any time.

~~~ sh
$ cd ~/.nodenv
$ git pull
~~~

To use a specific release of nodenv, check out the corresponding tag:

~~~ sh
$ cd ~/.nodenv
$ git fetch
$ git checkout v0.3.0
~~~

### Neckbeard Configuration

Skip this section unless you must know what every line in your shell
profile is doing.

`nodenv init` is the only command that crosses the line of loading
extra commands into your shell. Coming from RVM, some of you might be
opposed to this idea. Here's what `nodenv init` actually does:

1. Sets up your shims path. This is the only requirement for nodenv to
   function properly. You can do this by hand by prepending
   `~/.nodenv/shims` to your `$PATH`.

2. Installs autocompletion. This is entirely optional but pretty
   useful. Sourcing `~/.nodenv/completions/nodenv.bash` will set that
   up. There is also a `~/.nodenv/completions/nodenv.zsh` for Zsh
   users.

3. Rehashes shims. From time to time you'll need to rebuild your
   shim files. Doing this automatically makes sure everything is up to
   date. You can always run `nodenv rehash` manually.

4. Installs the sh dispatcher. This bit is also optional, but allows
   nodenv and plugins to change variables in your current shell, making
   commands like `nodenv shell` possible. The sh dispatcher doesn't do
   anything crazy like override `cd` or hack your shell prompt, but if
   for some reason you need `nodenv` to be a real script rather than a
   shell function, you can safely skip it.

Run `nodenv init -` for yourself to see exactly what happens under the
hood.

### Uninstalling Node Versions

As time goes on, Node versions you install will accumulate in your
`~/.nodenv/versions` directory.

To remove old Node versions, simply `rm -rf` the directory of the
version you want to remove. You can find the directory of a particular
Node version with the `nodenv prefix` command, e.g. `nodenv prefix
0.10.0`.

The [node-build](https://github.com/OiNutter/node-build) plugin
provides an `nodenv uninstall` command to automate the removal
process.

## Command Reference

Like `git`, the `nodenv` command delegates to subcommands based on its
first argument. The most common subcommands are:

### nodenv local

Sets a local application-specific Node version by writing the version
name to a `.node-version` file in the current directory. This version
overrides the global version, and can be overridden itself by setting
the `NODENV_VERSION` environment variable or with the `nodenv shell`
command.

    $ nodenv local 0.10.0

When run without a version number, `nodenv local` reports the currently
configured local version. You can also unset the local version:

    $ nodenv local --unset

Previous versions of nodenv stored local version specifications in a
file named `.nodenv-version`. For backwards compatibility, nodenv will
read a local version specified in an `.nodenv-version` file, but a
`.node-version` file in the same directory will take precedence.

### nodenv global

Sets the global version of Node to be used in all shells by writing
the version name to the `~/.nodenv/version` file. This version can be
overridden by an application-specific `.node-version` file, or by
setting the `NODENV_VERSION` environment variable.

    $ nodenv global 0.8.22

The special version name `system` tells nodenv to use the system Node
(detected by searching your `$PATH`).

When run without a version number, `nodenv global` reports the
currently configured global version.

### nodenv shell

Sets a shell-specific Node version by setting the `NODENV_VERSION`
environment variable in your shell. This version overrides
application-specific versions and the global version.

    $ nodenv shell 0.9.12

When run without a version number, `nodenv shell` reports the current
value of `NODENV_VERSION`. You can also unset the shell version:

    $ nodenv shell --unset

Note that you'll need nodenv's shell integration enabled (step 3 of
the installation instructions) in order to use this command. If you
prefer not to use shell integration, you may simply set the
`NODENV_VERSION` variable yourself:

    $ export NODENV_VERSION=0.10.0

### nodenv versions

Lists all Node versions known to nodenv, and shows an asterisk next to
the currently active version.

    $ nodenv versions
      0.8.22
      0.9.12
    * 0.10.0 (set by /Users/will/.nodenv/version)

### nodenv version

Displays the currently active Node version, along with information on
how it was set.

    $ nodenv version
    0.10.0 (set by /Volumes/OiNutter/hubot/.node-version)

### nodenv rehash

Installs shims for all Node executables known to nodenv (i.e.,
`~/.nodenv/versions/*/bin/*`). Run this command after you install a new
version of Node, or install a gem that provides commands.

    $ nodenv rehash

### nodenv which

Displays the full path to the executable that nodenv will invoke when
you run the given command.

    $ nodenv which npm
    /Users/will/.nodenv/versions/0.10.0/bin/npm

### nodenv whence

Lists all Node versions with the given command installed.

    $ nodenv whence npm
    0.10.0
    0.9.12
    0.8.22

## Development

The nodenv source code is [hosted on
GitHub](https://github.com/OiNutter/nodenv). It's clean, modular,
